## Workshop Overview

This workshop guides you through building a **Serverless File Notification System** using event-driven architecture on **AWS**. The system will automatically send email notifications whenever new files are uploaded to **S3**, without managing any servers.

## What is Serverless Architecture?

**Serverless Computing** is a cloud computing model where the service provider (AWS) fully manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on code rather than server management.

### Key Characteristics:
- **No Server Management**: No need to configure, patch, or maintain servers
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scales from 0 to thousands of requests
- **Pay-per-Use**: Only pay when code actually runs
- **High Availability**: Built-in fault tolerance and disaster recovery
- **Event-Driven**: Automatically responds to system events

## Event-Driven Architecture

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a design pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.

### Benefits of EDA:
- **Loose Coupling**: Independent components, easier to maintain and scale
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking processing improves performance
- **Resilience**: Component failure doesn't affect the entire system
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove components based on demand

## System Architecture

### Core Components:

#### 1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- **Role**: Event source and file storage
- **Functions**: 
  - Store files with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
  - Automatically trigger events on file upload
  - Support versioning and lifecycle management
- **Event Types**: ObjectCreated, ObjectRemoved, ObjectRestore...

#### 2. **AWS Lambda**
- **Role**: Event processor and business logic
- **Functions**:
  - Serverless compute service
  - Auto-scale from 0 to 1000+ concurrent executions
  - Support multiple runtimes: Python, Node.js, Java, Go...
  - Pay-per-request pricing model
- **Triggers**: S3 events, API Gateway, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch...

#### 3. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
- **Role**: Message delivery service
- **Functions**:
  - Pub/Sub messaging pattern
  - Support multiple protocols: Email, SMS, HTTP, SQS...
  - Message filtering and fanout capabilities
  - Dead Letter Queue for error handling

### Advanced Components (Option 2):

#### 4. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Role**: NoSQL database for metadata
- **Features**:
  - Fully managed NoSQL database
  - Single-digit millisecond latency
  - Auto-scaling read/write capacity
  - Global Tables for multi-region replication

#### 5. **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**
- **Role**: Message queuing service
- **Benefits**:
  - Decouple components
  - Handle traffic spikes
  - Ensure message delivery
  - Dead Letter Queue support

#### 6. **Amazon API Gateway**
- **Role**: REST API endpoint
- **Features**:
  - Request/response transformation
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Rate limiting & throttling
  - API versioning & deployment stages

#### 7. **Amazon CloudWatch**
- **Role**: Monitoring and logging
- **Capabilities**:
  - Metrics collection & visualization
  - Log aggregation & analysis
  - Alarms & notifications
  - Custom dashboards

## Data Flow

### Option 1 - Basic Flow:
```
User Upload → S3 Bucket → S3 Event → Lambda Function → SNS Topic → Email Notification
```

### Option 2 - Advanced Flow:
```
User Upload → S3 Bucket → S3 Event → Lambda Function → DynamoDB (metadata)
                                                   → SQS Queue → Processing Lambda
                                                   → SNS Topic → Email Notification
API Gateway ← Web Interface ← CloudWatch Dashboard ← Monitoring
```

## System Benefits

### 1. **Cost Efficiency**
- **No idle costs**: Only pay for actual usage
- **Free tier**: AWS provides generous free tier for services
- **Automatic optimization**: AWS automatically optimizes infrastructure

### 2. **Scalability**
- **Horizontal scaling**: Automatically scales with demand
- **No capacity planning**: No need to predict traffic
- **Global reach**: Easy deployment across multiple regions

### 3. **Reliability**
- **High availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA
- **Fault tolerance**: Built-in redundancy
- **Disaster recovery**: Multi-AZ deployment

### 4. **Developer Productivity**
- **Focus on business logic**: No infrastructure management needed
- **Rapid development**: Quick deployment and iteration
- **Rich ecosystem**: Many managed services for integration

## Real-world Use Cases

### 1. **Content Management Systems**
- Auto-resize images on upload
- Generate thumbnails and previews
- Virus scanning for uploaded files

### 2. **Data Processing Pipelines**
- ETL workflows for big data
- Real-time analytics
- Machine learning inference

### 3. **IoT Applications**
- Sensor data processing
- Real-time alerting
- Device management

### 4. **E-commerce Platforms**
- Order processing workflows
- Inventory management
- Customer notifications
